# [WIP]
# ELECTRA Lightning
This is just another ELECTRA re-implementation, but on pytorch-lightning. 
Currently, there are several ELECTRA implementation, which have helped 
me in considerably to make my own, in particular, the implementations 
made by [Richard Wang](https://github.com/richarddwang/electra_pytorch), 
[Phil Wang](https://github.com/lucidrains/electra-pytorch) and of course
the official implementation by [Google](https://github.com/google-research/electra).

## Motivation
Although all the implementation mentioned above have a high quality. I want to do 
some multi-modal experiments using this model. So I need a bit more of control. 
In addition, I also want to play a bit training language models and ELECTRA is 
the only one (for now) that allows me to train interesting models using
achievable computational power.
